## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. The input shape of the model is (128, 128, 3) and the output shape is (1,). The model uses the'relu' activation function for the convolutional layers and the'softmax' activation function for the output layer. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32. The model was trained for 10 epochs.

## Training

The model was trained on the IMDb movie review dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. The dataset was split into a training set and a test set, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% used for testing. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32. The model was trained for 10 epochs.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated on the test set and achieved an accuracy of 85%. This means that the model was able to correctly classify 85% of the movie reviews in the test set as either positive or negative.

## Usage

To use the model, simply provide it with a movie review as input. The model will then output a probability that the review is positive or negative. For example, if the model is provided with the review ""This movie is amazing!"", it may output a probability of 0.9 that the review is positive. If the model is provided with the review ""This movie is terrible!"", it may output a probability of 0.9 that the review is negative.

## Recommendation

Based on the user's reviews, a good movie recommendation would be 'As Above, So Below' as it has a high rating of 5.0/5 and the user has previously enjoyed movies with a similar rating. Additionally, the user has mentioned that they enjoy movies with 'jump scares' and 'deep' storylines, both of which are present in 'As Above, So Below'. Therefore, it is likely that the user will enjoy this movie"

Based on the user's reviews, they seem to enjoy movies with complex characters, thought-provoking themes, and high production values. 'Some Guy Who Kills People' is a low-budget horror-comedy film that may not meet the user's expectations. Therefore, I would not recommend it.

Instead, I would recommend a movie that aligns more closely with the user's stated preferences. For example, 'Jormungand: The Complete First Series' is a highly-rated anime series that the user has already expressed interest in. Alternatively, 'The Tale of the Princess Kaguya' is a critically-acclaimed animated film that may appeal to the user's appreciation for high-quality production values."
