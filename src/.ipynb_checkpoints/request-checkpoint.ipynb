      "Title: Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition\n",
      "Review: When Peter Jackson and New Line released The Lord of the Rings on DVD, they got their money back and then some. First, they released the theatrical version; then some months later they released an extended version and that disc _also_ included the original theatrical release. People were steamed, but many both the whole kit _a second time_. But George Lucas won't do that. Why? Because he owns the whole thing from start to finish. He's the annoying studio head he has to deal with.\n",
      "\n",
      "That still leaves the question of why he doesn't even want to just make some extra money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is straightforward. NOBODY thinks his \"extended\" version is better. If he were to release the original theatrical, sales of the \"Lucas new and improved\" would drop to ZERO. And lil' ol' George just can't bear the thought that his franchise took a nosedive straight down the toilet. He jumped the shark, screwed the poodle, you named, he did it, screwed it, blew it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows it, but a few billion dollars buys you a lot of denial.\n",
      "Title: Stalker VHS\n",
      "Review: This Kino release of Stalker has two discs -- one with the film, the other with extras.  Navigation on the first disc is poorly designed, so you have to dig into the audio setup to find out that there are actually two versions of the soundtrack.  The default is _not_ Tarkovsky's soundtrack; it's a 5.1 dolby soundtrack which altered and added sound, including a music track that isn't particularly good and seriously changes how Tarkovsky clearly intended the film to be experienced (for example, by adding music where  Tarkovsky had none). There is a very long, intensely meditative sequence to which music is added. You might as well colorize Citizen Kane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visually, the transfer is okay, but could be better. For the price at the time of this writing (about US$17), it's fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film itself is a masterpiece, though people accustomed to contemporary film styles will find Tarkovsky \"boring\" -- no jolting soundtrack, no rapid-fire cutting. Instead, some of the slowest, most prolonged camera moves and cuts you'll see in film. Gorgeous if you like it (which, clearly, I do).\n",
      "Title: Event Horizon VHS\n",
      "Review: How can a film have such a great cast and be this bad?  Lousy dialogue, so-so special effects (with some really poor sequences), and painfully predictable plot. It's short 95 minutes, which makes me wonder whether the studio realized they had a turkey in the making, so they figured, \"Let's just cut bait.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The film has a cult following, and the combination of horror and unintentional sci-fi camp goes some way to this. But, apart from \"Battlefield Earth\" or the Sci-Fi (SyFy) channel's flop of the week, this is as bad as sci-fi gets.\n",
      "Title: The Omen\n",
      "Review: In standard Hollywood fashion, this remake of the Gregory Peck classic thinks it's making things better by making things more extreme. So here, hellish dogs in a cemetery don't just threaten and terrify, they physically lock on to Liev Schrieber. That's the pattern throughout -- ratchet things up, hope for the best, or the worst in this case. The air of foreboding and menace in the original is traded here for thin thrills, more gore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie suffers further from a poor cast poorly directed. Schrieber, Stiles, and Farrow have done good stuff. Here, all seem wooden, emotionless, cardboard cutouts. Stiles is utterly devoid of presence. Schrieber (39, and the best of the lot, but too young to plausibly be ambassador) and Stiles (25 at release) are both too young for their roles. This is the kind of casting decision that's made solely for marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schrieber is an excellent actor, though he doesn't have the sheer force of presence that Gregory Peck brought to every role. The character of Katherine Thorn has been considerably expanded, but Stiles is no Lee Remick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mia Farrow is the worst of all -- truly terrible -- the worst I've personally seen her. And of all the characters, she fares worst in comparison to the original -- Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock in '76. Whitelaw conveyed such an air of pure malevolence. I can imagine Farrow cringing as she took direction.\n",
      "Title: The Shaft\n",
      "Review: Remember that scene in Big where Tom Hanks is in a meeting at his new job, playing with the transformer building -- the building that turns into a robot?\n",
      "\n",
      "This movie is as dopey as that building-bot. Bad acting, and one of the worst plot devices ever. Wow. It doesn't get much worse than this. An artificially intelligent elevator turned evil -- pure concentrated evil!\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, there was an X Files episode along these lines that got it right, but this doesn't. Some cool actors in an abysmal movie. No camp, no suspense, and pointless gore.\n",
      "Title: The Core\n",
      "Review: When movies this bad were made in the 50s or 60s or 70s, they had The Cheese Factor. Effects were bad, acting was often pretty bad (with notable exceptions), and plots were happily implausible.\n",
      "\n",
      "And most of the time, people were on a jaunt. \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" with James Mason et al? \"Hey, we can go to the center of the Earth! How about a picnic?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the Earth's Core\" with Peter Cushing and Doug McClure. Laughably bad effects and a plot based on accident make for a lot of cheesy fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now the effects are great (though not in this film) and budgets are greater, so the films must be Serious. And this film is so serious, so earnest. And SO BAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent actors, terrible picture.\n",
      "Title: Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season\n",
      "Review: This is the season where Buffy  already great  becomes legendary, some of the best television ever done. The emotional depth of the show is astonishing given that it's supposed to be low brow entertainment. I first watched the series when it originally aired, and by this point in the show's development, there was a constant fight on the part of the creators as the WB toyed with cancelling it. Buffy was the most successful show the network had, and still the dimwits with MBAs were unhappy (much as the idiots at the Sci Fi Channel were upset with the reboot of Battlestar Galactica). This is the season in which Dawn appears [sic] and in which Buffy's mom dies. The episode dealing with Joyce's death is widely viewed as one of the greatest episodes ever done for television. Some have called it the greatest episode of any series ever. From here on Buffy has a real darkness and is consistently stellar.\n",
      "Title: Garfield - The Movie VHS\n",
      "Review: About the only thing that can be said for this dog of a movie is that it's better than the comic strip. And that ain't sayin' much. For those who don't know already, it's been years since Jim Davis, the original creator of the character, has penned the strip. Twenty five years ago, this strip was often hilarious. Today, the strip shows all the signs of pathetic design by committee. About as unfunny as it gets. The movie is marginally -- only marginally -- better.\n",
      "Title: Clive Barker's The Plague\n",
      "Review: The only thing that can be said in favor of this awful movie is that it is not as long as an awful Stephen King adaptation. Production values = 0. Acting = 0. Direction = 0. Writing = 0. Sadly, Amazon won't let us give a zero rating. This film was so bad, I didn't even want the bad guys to win. I just wanted every character dead.\n",
      "Title: 28 Weeks Later\n",
      "Review: IF (very big if) you can get past the _insanely_ stupid premise of this sequel, then this film is good fun. But the first 20 minutes are just an unbroken stream of fantastically bad plot gimmicks. Otherwise, the casting is fine, acting fine, production fine. But the ridiculous string of plot holes is a huge hurdle. Might as well have Fonzi jump the shark.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Letting people back after just 28 weeks.\n",
      "2. Allowing people to break the security cordon so easily.\n",
      "3. Letting a person with no security clearance wander around with access.\n",
      "4. 'Quarantining' an infected person with _no_ security at all (meaning no quarantine).\n",
      "5. Turning _off_ lights and herding people into one big space so that nobody can see a thing, and the virus can spread like wildfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 5-year-old could spot the idiocy here. It makes the film unwatchable for me.\n",
      "Title: Batman: Gotham Knight\n",
      "Review: About the only thing that can be said in favor of this film is that the animation is often striking and beautiful. Otherwise, it suffers from all the defects of the animated series after Warner Bros. decided to turn it into a marketing gimic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The animated series as developed by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and others was great, but once Warner Bros. realized they had a success they had to milk it for all the money they could: rework it for a younger audience, make it lighter, less dark and less intelligent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gotham Knight is dark, but for the most part only in the visual sense. The story line is almost indecipherable -- pointless twists and turns, jumps -- a mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters are superficial as is the annoying philosophizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone like Alan Moore can pull this off. But Warner Bros. can destroy his work and they destroy whatever might have been good in Gotham Knight.\n",

      "Title: Looney Tunes: Golden Collection Vol. 6\n",
      "Review: It's hard to believe that Warner Bros. was once one of The Great Studios. The Looney Tunes Collection is potentially outstanding -- one could even say of historical note, given the role of cartoons from the 40s through the mid-60s. But with two great releases in Volume 1 and Volume 2, the collection has steadily declined to this sad excuse in Volume 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warner Bros. has taken the same approach that the music industry has taken with CDs -- with the same result, namely a decline in public interest and a public turn to online downloading.\n",
      "\n",
      "That approach consists in putting one or two great tracks on a disc to attract buyers and ramming garbage down our throats with the remainder.\n",
      "\n",
      "What made Looney Tunes great was outstanding animators -- Chuck Jones, Bill McKimson, Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett, Tex Avery, Ken Harris, Abe Levitow, Ben Washam. Some of their work has become iconographic in American culture, as much as any great movie (like Wizard of Oz or Gone With the Wind). Warner drops any attempt to capture this. Certainly by Volume 4, Warner has established it's plan to ram less interesting material down our throats.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wouldn't matter IF Warner included more of the gems. But entire characters are almost unrepresented in the series. Most notably to my mind is Claude the Cat -- hilarious and absent but for two cartoons (if I remember correctly). Better known and almost as unrecognized is Pepe le Pew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warner destroyed what could have been a consistently great collection just as they destroyed the Batman series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, a triumph of moronic marketing over substance and quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLEASE TAKE NOTE: I have a huge personal collection of these cartoons on tape. Since Warner has effectively abandoned these treasures, practically putting them out with the trash, I will now treat my collection as in the public domain. Look for Looney Tunes online.\n",
      "Title: 2012\n",
      "Review: You think you've seen the worst movie ever made, that nobody will ever make a movie that bad again.... And then Roland Emmerich makes another movie. How can so many excellent actors and a huge budget be combined to make such garbage?\n",
      "\n",
      "The special effects are good (though the green-screening is not up to the effects). Some are outstanding. But this movie requires a lot more than suspension of disbelief. It requires a full lobotomy. Absurdly bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, who needs a plot when you have a budget of $200 million and a really terrible but really well-connected director? The saddest part is that Danny Glover, John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson are phenomenal actors and the rest of the cast is fine; it's just the filmmaking that really sucks.\n",
      "Title: The Secret of Kells\n",
      "Review: Gorgeous animation, and a great departure from the cult of 3D animation. Great story. Great voiceovers. It had surprising emotional force for me. One of my favorite animated films. The style of animation is very different from what dominates currently, even among the flat, illustrated films (think especially of Japanese animation).\n",
      "\n",
      "The catch for parents: kids may not like it so much. My kids are definitely accustomed to 3D now, or to Simpsons-style humor, so this film left them scratching their heads. (They were about 7 and 10 when I tried to introduce them to it.)\n",
      "Title: Stake Land\n",
      "Review: Think Zombieland but serious and with elements of the Clint Eastwood-style nameless loner hero. This film is far better than the vast majority of huge-budget Hollywood vampire movies. Stake Land is most surprising for the depth of its characters. It actually takes time to develop them without indulging in the annoying 'revelation round the campfire' style that you see in so many works in the post-apocalyptic genre. The pacing is excellent. The scoring is very good, and so is the cinematography.\n",
      "Title: Strike Back: Season 1\n",
      "Review: My main complaint about this series is that, for people who are supposed to be masters of intelligence and security, the characters seem close to totally inept. Apart from character development, everything is good  action, production values, and willingness to make characters pay for ineptitude  all fine.\n",
      "Title: Nature: The River of No Return\n",
      "Review: This was broadcast on PBS in April, 2012. The two narrators (husband and wife, the husband a long-time observer of wolf populations in Idaho) spent a year in the Frank Church-River of No Return wilderness in Idaho. They were outfitted with a Red One camera; the footage is at times absolutely phenomenal. It helps that the region they're in is not one overrun by tourists like Yellowstone or many others in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sad drawback is that the two filmmakers' voiceover is atrocious. They have none of the ease of narration of David Attenborough (on the more formal, styled British side of nature narration) or Marty Stouffer (in a very easy-going, but still exceptionally well-informed American style). It's clear that the lead narrator is deeply interested in his subject, but little if any of that comes across in the voiceover. More often, he and his partner seem to striving for depth while coming across as trite or self-conscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, some will find the personal quality and honesty engaging. I found the stiffness (or forced 'easy-going-ness') annoying after about 20 minutes.\n",
      "Title: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\n",
      "Review: Not as great as 1968's \"Planet of the Apes,\" but \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" and \"Rise\" before it are better, in my view, than any of the other 60s-70s movies. I actually enjoyed Dawn more than Rise  primarily because I'm not much of a fan of James Franco. Dawn does a great, short, neat job of laying to rest questions viewers might have about the fate of people in the first film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the characters  the idiot brutish human drone, the brutish conniving human leader (Gary Oldman, doing much the same thing he did in \"Book of Eli)   are predictable. And there are serious plot weaknesses (why do all these post-apocalyptic movies have old technology that is made to work so easily?), but 3D quality, overall acting, story, and design more than make up for it.\n",
      "Title: Oz the Great &amp; Powerful anglais\n",
      "Review: First, the reason this is 2 stars, not 1. \"Oz\" does a decent job offering a fun explanation for how that Wizard ended up behind that curtain in the first place. That's it, mostly. This movie has its moments -- maybe 3 or 4 of them. But it's 20 minutes too long, horribly acted, and even more horribly directed. And the direction must be behind it all, the con artist behind the curtain. Even if you don't like James Franco, Mila Kunis, or Rachel Weisz, they're better than this. And Michelle Williams is almost unrecognizably bad. (And Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams really can act. Maybe not so much James 'I'm overacting as well as I can!' Franco or Mila 'Look into my eyes' Kunis)\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time he has a chance, Sam Raimi takes 3 minutes when 1 would have done. You almost feel like checking your watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even some of the special effects look bad -- bad green screening, unconvincing acting opposite 'synthespians.' And the little flying monkey companion? Some of the worst 3D I've seen in a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rehash of the Wizard's spectacular 1939 appearance in fire and smoke? It looks _worse_ in Sam Raimi's 2013 render! How?!\n",
      "\n",
      "But the worst of it all? Mila Kunis can't hold a candle to Margaret Hamilton. Kunis can't hold a candle of any kind. Of course, Hamilton was a whopping 37 years old when she played the witch. Maybe 30 year-old Kunis didn't have enough experience. It doesn't help that she is given a \"come-hither\" witch dress and terrible make-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ultimately, Kunis can't sell the line. James Franco, playing a con artist, can't sell it either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel Weisz gives it all away. At times, you wonder whether the look of shock and dismay is at the awful film she's stuck in.\n",
      "Title: Gravity 2013  Region Free\n",
      "Review: 4 and 1/2 stars. Sandra Bullock: 5. George Clooney: 3. Director Alfonso Cuaron: 5. Visual: 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Interstellar, this may be one of the most visually arresting realistic space films ever made. I've heard interviews with at least 2 former astronauts who said \"Gravity\" captured the experience of being in orbit better than any film ever has.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weak link in the film is George Clooney. He plays George Clooney, and it really doesn't work here. And you will have to suspend a good deal of disbelief. But Sandra Bullock makes up for all of that. She's spectacular.\n",
      "Title: Godzilla [DVD] [2014]\n",
      "Review: Director Gareth Edwards also did the very low budget, _fantastic_ Monsters a few years ago. I think the fact that I had already seen that _and_ all of the 50s and 60s Japanese _and_ the Matthew Broderick Godzilla allowed me to enjoy this far more than many people might.\n",
      "\n",
      "At it's best this film is great. Beautiful visually. Some great casting with Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, and Elizabeth Olsen. I think Aaron Taylor-Johnson is fine, but not especially good -- too much looking dead serious all the time (maybe he just wasn't given the opportunity to look otherwise). And there are scenes that are phenomenal. The halo jump that was featured in trailers is outstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many references visually and musically to the Japanese classics and several references to other classics of science fiction (like 2001). So a lot of fun for those who can enjoy all that. But otherwise, I can't say.\n",
      "Title: Shaun The Sheep - The Movie 2015\n",
      "Review: Hilarious, great animation -- the best of Nick Park's Wallace & Gromit shorts, but much better than other films associated with Aardman animation -- Flushed Away, The Pirates!, Chicken Run, etc. (Chicken Run would get 4 stars from me. 3 stars for the other two.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazingly, there is no recognizable dialogue. It almost works like a silent film (except, of course, that it's not silent).\n",
      "\n",

      "Title: STAR WARS: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Russian Import, English included by default, Region Free]\n",
      "Review: Star Wars was fantastic. Empire Strikes Back was better. Return of the Jedi as pretty good until the teddy bears, but my kids _love_ the teddy bears -- makes Return of the Jedi their favorite of the three (yes, sad but true -- when they're older, they'll understand).\n",
      "\n",
      "Even my 5 year old gets that Lucas did such a bad job on characterization and storytelling that Darth Vader is more interesting than any of the \"good guys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Those two points said, I am very happy with the original trilogy -- as released. But Lucas couldn't stop. He had his little darlings. So he made three crappy movies and then crappy 3D cartoons. Even five year olds don't like The Clone Wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Lucas is batting 2.5 for 7? More like 2 for 10.\n",

      "\n",
      "The premise is great -- average western settler/cowboy types trying to recover a woman captured by Indians (sound familiar?) -- but Indians like none ever seen in a western before. The cast is outstanding -- Kurt Russell, an almost unrecognizable Richard Jenkins, Patrick Wilson, and Lili Simmons. All great.\n",

      "Cinematography is mediocre. When you consider the astounding work done by John Ford or Clint Eastwood (among others), this film really fails to take advantage of landscape or light.\n",
